# Welzijn AI app
This project has to do with (electronic) healthcare. 
This is an app that monitors the well-being of the patients with the help of a chatbot companion app.  The chatbot integrates questions from the medical questionnaire EQ-5D-5L into a natural conversation, with the intent that users are more willing and detailed in providing information about their well-being. It should also serve as a companion for patients who feel lonely. The user's response to each question will be mapped to a scale that quantifies the level of positivity or negativity in their response. The results of the questionnaire are then sent to caretakers, who will decide whether the patient requires additional care. 

# Features
- Speech Interaction: Engage in a natural, speech-based conversation with the chatbot.
- Questionnaire Integration: Subtly integrates a health questionnaire without user awareness.
- LLM Integration: Utilizes Groq llama3 for generating responses.
- Result Monitoring: Scaled questionnaire results for health professionals.
- Humorous Responses: Designed to be light-hearted and humorous to maintain user engagement.
